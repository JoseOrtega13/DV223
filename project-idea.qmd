Could not really find a specific data set I want for my topic but checked this suggested website and found some potential options, but nothing exactly yet. I plan on researching the most effective place strikers score goals from in the English Premier League. I'll find a data set with all the goals from the EPL in a season then narrow it down to the most specific areas.
